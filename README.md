# Srtd - A task management app for humans

## Global TODOs

### SOMEDAY

- Maybe use [brick-panes](https://github.com/kquick/brick-panes) to abstract over the different sub-components.
  - This *might* be a better version of the `Component` class I made.
  - Check out [mywork](https://github.com/kquick/mywork), which is implemented using it.
  - Does it handle overlay or tabs? (or can it be made to?)

- Contribute some of the modules, e.g., `Aligment` to Brick.
